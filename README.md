# rekordbox-sample-killer
Automatically remove the annoying Rekordbox samples that get automatically added after each update.

Simply run the script after each time you update Rekordbox.

If you found this useful, I would appreciate if you could take a moment to check out my music:

Note: There's a variable at the top of the script; `$basepath`, which is set to `C:\Program Files\rekordbox`.

I use a non-standard installation location but I *believe* this is the default. If I'm wrong, please let me know & I'll update it.

In any case, if your installation path differs, simply change this variable.
